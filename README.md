1. 这个仓库包含了一些RHEL运维知识分享，和我自己做的一些案例，这些案例已经被封装成了可移植的项目文件，欢迎大家学习和下载。
2. 本仓库的笔记是基于Obsidian软件进行记录的,但是也提供了标准markdown版本。其中.mark标识的文件夹就是标准`markdown`版本，`.obs`标识的文件夹则是`obsidian`版本，大家可以按需使用。
3. 本仓库创建的目的是为了记录运维学习的足迹。其中目录`rhel`下的每个文件夹的名在代表的就是这个技术的名称。这些文件夹下也有对应的`readme.md`方便高效的学习文件。

RHEL Operations Knowledge Base & Learning Tracks
Welcome to my repository! This is a structured collection of RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) operation and maintenance (O&M) insights, documentation, and practical automation scripts.

📂 Repository Structure
This repository is organized by technology domains rather than tools. Each unit represents a core RHEL technical capability.

1. The rhel/ Directory (The Knowledge Core)
Domain-Based Folders: Each sub-folder (e.g., dns/, firewalld/, storage/) represents a specific technical domain.

Internal READMEs: Inside each folder, you will find a dedicated README.md that explains the concepts, configuration steps, and best practices for that specific technology.

2. Dual-Format Documentation System
To provide the best reading experience across different platforms, I maintain two versions of the notes:

📁 .obs Folders: Tailored for Obsidian users. It preserves bi-directional links and the knowledge graph.

📁 .mark Folders: Standard Markdown version. These are "Git-friendly" and can be read perfectly on GitHub or any standard Markdown viewer.

3. Practical Implementations (The "Automation" Unit)
Selected modules include encapsulated Ansible projects.

These are not just code snippets, but portable, ready-to-run automation units designed to solve real-world O&M tasks.

🎯 Project Mission
This repository is a living "footprint" of my learning journey. It aims to:

Standardize RHEL configuration processes.

Bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and automated execution.

Provide a modular reference for fellow Linux enthusiasts.

🌏 Language
I am a learner from China. Currently, the detailed content is provided in Chinese. However, the structure and automation logic are designed to be universally understandable.

If you find this structured knowledge base helpful, please give it a ⭐ Star!



The primary goal of this repository is to document my "footprints" and growth in the field of IT Operations and Automation. It serves as both a personal knowledge base and a shareable resource for the community.
